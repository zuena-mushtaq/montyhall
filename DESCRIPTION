Description: This package will run the Monty Hall game. This is a simulation of a game from a television game show called, "Let's Make a Deal". It is named after its original host, Monty Hall. The game proceeds as follows: The player gets to choose one door out of 3 doors. Behind one of the doors is a car. And the two other doors have a goat behind them. If the player picked the door with a car behind it, they get to  keep the car. To add to this game, Monty opens one of the two remaining doors with a goat behind it. Then he allows the player to either stay with their initial door that they picked or switch their door. Now comes the most important question of all - What should the player do?
